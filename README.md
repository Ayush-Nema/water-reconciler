Note:

1. June and March 2025 readings are estimated. Will be replaced with originals later.
    - March values are estimated as the average of Feb and Apr costs
    - June's values are considered as `=RANDBETWEEN(min(B41:I41), max(B41:I41))`
        - `B41` to `I41` is the monthly data range
2. `is_faulty` argument is not yet operational but functionality will be added soon.
